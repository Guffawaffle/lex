# Lex Instructions

> **Use Lex Memory.** Before starting work, run `lex recall "topic"` to retrieve prior context.

## Core Commands

```bash
lex recall "topic"     # Retrieve relevant context before work
lex remember           # Store context after completing work
lex timeline           # View recent work history
lex check              # Validate policy compliance
```

## Key Principle

**Lex is the constitution, not the government.** Schemas, contracts, and memory are stable surfaces. Don't leak implementation details into them.
