# Lex Instructions

This file is the canonical source of AI assistant guidance for this repository. Content from this file is projected to host files (like `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).

## What Lex Does in This Repository

Lex provides memory and policy management for AI-assisted development:

- **Memory:** Stores and retrieves episodic context about work sessions
- **Policy:** Enforces module ownership and dependency rules
- **Atlas:** Maps code structure for navigation and understanding

## Key Files

- `lexmap.policy.json` — Module ownership and dependency policy
- `**/CONTRACT.md` — Frozen interface contracts (do not modify without approval)
- `.smartergpt/` — Local workspace (gitignored, not committed)

## Situational Guidance

### When Planning Work

1. Use `lex recall "topic"` to find relevant prior context
2. Check `lex timeline` to understand recent work history
3. Review policy files before proposing architectural changes

### When Editing Code

1. Respect module boundaries defined in `lexmap.policy.json`
2. Honor frozen contracts (`CONTRACT.md` files)
3. Use `lex remember` to capture important context for future sessions

### When Reviewing

1. Verify changes align with existing policy constraints
2. Check that new dependencies follow established patterns
3. Ensure documentation is updated alongside code changes

## Memory Commands

```bash
# Store context for future sessions
lex remember --reference-point "feature-name" --summary "What was accomplished"

# Retrieve relevant context
lex recall "search query"

# View recent work history
lex timeline

# Check policy compliance
lex check
```
