# Lex Instructions

> **Use Lex Memory.** Before starting work, run `lex recall "topic"` to retrieve prior context.

## Core Commands

```bash
lex recall "topic"     # Retrieve relevant context before work
lex remember           # Store context after completing work
lex timeline           # View recent work history
lex check              # Validate policy compliance
```

## Key Principle

**Lex is the constitution, not the government.** Schemas, contracts, and memory are stable surfaces. Don't leak implementation details into them.

## Quick Links

- `docs/FOUNDERS_NOTE.md` — Philosophy
- `docs/CONTRACT_SURFACE.md` — Contract surface (v1)
- `canon/policy/lexmap.policy.json` — Module boundaries

*Run `lex recall` for detailed guidance on any topic.*

## 🔐 Admin Authority

Copilot agents have delegated `--admin` merge authority when local CI passes.
Run `lex recall "admin authority"` for conditions.

---

## 🎭 Behavioral Layer (LexSona)

Persona execution is handled by **LexSona** (separate package).
Lex provides the behavioral memory socket (`recordCorrection`, `getRules`).

For persona-based workflows, see LexSona documentation.

---

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

Run `lex recall` for detailed guidance on:
- `lex recall "git tests"` — NO git commits in tests (GPG signing hangs)
- `lex recall "sql safety"` — Curated query modules only
- `lex recall "ip boundary"` — Lex never imports from lexrunner

---

## Build & Test

```bash
npm ci && npm run build && npm test && npm run lint
npm run local-ci  # Full CI pipeline
```

If SQLite tests fail: `npm run rebuild-sqlite`
